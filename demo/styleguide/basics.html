        <li>This sub-site provides development teams at Rackspace with a set of design patterns, to help ensure a consistent and unified look-and-feel for all products under the Encore umbrella.</li>
        <li>This section of the Demo site focuses mainly on markup, CSS and design patterns. If you're curious about Encore-specific angular.js directives, find the "All Components" section in the left hand navigation.</li>
        <li>If you're a Rackspace team outside of Encore and need help setting up an new project from an engineering perspective, go to this <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/guides/getting-started.md">Getting Started guide</a> in the EncoreUI repository.

            <li>For the most part, RackSpace developer teams will be creating mark-up using the <a href="http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/component/rxApp">rxPage subdirective of rxApp</a> as a container.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/rxApp/templates/rxPage.html">rxPage's template code</a> contains a breadcrumb component, an attribute to pre-fill titles and subtitles and a rxNotification container so you can send page-level communication errors and validation messages in a standardized way. Check the angular.js code for controllers within Cloud Encore for implementation examples.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/tree/master/src/rxApp">rxApp</a> <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/rxApp/common.less">common.less file</a> defines many base CSS rules and classes for app use. Included in this is <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>. This helps create a consistent starting point for styles across all browsers.</li>

        <li>Kevin Lamping, a developer on the EncoreUI team, wrote a document to address <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/guides/css-styleguide.md">coding standards while writing CSS</a>.</li>

            <li>Modal wells: Modal wells are used in the context of modals, typically to provide a summary of data entered or decisions made by the user in a form to provide a clearer picture to the user of changes they are about to submit. Use the class <code>modal-well</code> for this type of well.</li>
            <li>Left-aligned wells: These wells are used in conjunction with forms in much the same way modal wells are utilized, except left-aligned wells appear in a full-page context. Use the class <code>well</code> for this type of well.</li>
            <li>Center-aligned wells: These wells are used to communicate why data is not present for the user, usually if data can only be seen with a permissions the user has not been granted. In other cases, it may be used to prompt the user to add data to an empty notes field. When utilizing this kind of well, list items may be appropriate. Use the classes <code>well</code> and <code>centered</code> for this type of well. Use the class <code>list</code> on a <code>ul</code> for correct styles and alignment.</li>

    <li>Full Width: <code>.full-width</code> class that marks content as full width (e.g. to give a button full width). Requires 'display' to be defined as inline-block or block.</li>
    <li>Hidden content
        <ul class="list">
            <li><code>.hidden</code> class - Will add to hide an element but not remove it from the spacing of the page.</li>

            <li>Several options for displaying text with a progress bar are available: no text, a percentage (not italicized), and detailed text (italicized). Showing a percent is preferred to showing nothing. However, the more specific text is the ideal state, since it reveals both numeric progress and provides context for what progress is being tracked.
