 * # rxForm Component
 *
 * The rxForm component contains a set of directives used to create forms throughout Encore.  These directives provide
 * a common HTML layout and style for all form elements, which helps ensure form accessibility and makes creating new
 *  forms easier.
 *
 * ## Directives Are Hierarchical
 *
 * To provide a standard layout of form fields (and so CSS rules can apply that layout), most of the new directives
 *  must be nested in a specific hierarchy.
 *  If you do not nest these elements properly, Angular will throw an error (this is by design). So, rule of thumb,
 *  aim for `0` console errors.
 *
 * These directives must be nested in the following hierarchy (*the ranges (e.g., 0..1) below denote how many items can
 *  be nested within its parent*):
 *
 * * {@link rxForm.directive:rxForm rxForm}
 *   * {@link rxForm.directive:rxFormSection rxFormSection} (0..N)
 *      * {@link elements.directive:rxSelectFilter rxSelectFilter} (0..N)
 *      * {@link rxForm.directive:rxField rxField} (0..N)
 *        * {@link rxForm.directive:rxFieldName rxFieldName} (0..1)
 *        * {@link rxForm.directive:rxFieldContent rxFieldContent} (0..1)
 *          * {@link rxForm.directive:rxInput rxInput} (0..N)
 *            * {@link rxForm.directive:rxPrefix rxPrefix} (0..1)
 *            * {@link rxForm.directive:rxInfix rxInfix} (0..1)
 *            * {@link rxForm.directive:rxSuffix rxSuffix} (0..1)
 *
 * ## Free-Range Directives
 * These directives are not limited to their placement and can be used anywhere:
 *
 * * {@link rxForm.directive:rxHelpText rxHelpText}
 *   * Designed to style form control help text.
 * * {@link rxForm.directive:rxInlineError rxInlineError}
 *   * Designed to style form control error messages.
 *
 * ## Compatible Modules
 * These modules work well with rxForm.
 *
 * * {@link elements.directive:rxButton rxButton}
 * * {@link rxCharacterCount}
 * * {@link elements.directive:rxCheckbox rxCheckbox}
 * * {@link rxMultiSelect}
 * * {@link rxOptionTable}
 * * {@link rxRadio}
 * * {@link rxSearchBox}
 * * {@link rxSelect}
 * * {@link rxToggleSwitch}
 * * {@link typeahead}
 *
 * # Layout
 *
 * ## Stacked Field Arrangement
 * By default, `rx-form-section` will arrange its children inline, in a row.  To obtain a stacked, columnar layout
 * for a particular section, place the `stacked` attribute on the `rx-form-section` element.  This will arrange the
 * `rx-field`, `rx-select-filter`, and `div` children elements in a columnar fashion.  This can be used in conjunction
 * with sections taking the full width of the form.
 *
 *  *See "Advanced Inputs" in the {@link /encore-ui/#/components/rxForm demo} for an example.*
 *
 * ## Responsive
 * `rx-field` and `div` elements that are immediate children of `rx-form-section` will grow from 250px to full width of
 * the section.  As such, you will see that these elements will wrap in the section if there's not enough width to
 * accomodate more than one child.
 *
 * *You can see this in the {@link /encore-ui/#/components/rxForm demo} if you resize the width of your browser.*
 *
 * # Validation
 *
 * ## Required Fields
 * When displaying a field that should be required, please make use of the `ng-required` attribute for rxFieldName.
 * When the value evaluates to true, an asterisk will display to the left of the field name.  You can see an example
 * of this with the "Required Textarea" field name in the {@link /encore-ui/#/components/rxForm demo}.
 *
 * See {@link rxForm.directive:rxFieldName rxFieldName}
 * API Documentation for more information.
 *
 * ## Custom Validators
 *
 * Angular provides its own validator when you use `type="email"`, and you can use `<rx-inline-error>` to turn email
 * validation errors into a styled message.  You can also use this element if you define a custom validator.
 *
 * ### Foocheck validator
 * The example shown in the "Email Address" example, uses a custom `foocheck` validator. Note that it is enabled by
 * placing the `foocheck` attribute in the `<input>` element, and using it with
 * `ng-show="demoForm.userEmail.$error.foocheck"`.  Check out the Javascript tab in
 * the {@link /encore-ui/#/components/rxForm demo} to see how this validator is implemented.
 *
 * There are plenty of examples online showing the same thing.
 *
 * # Migrating Old Code
 *
 * ## Deprecated Directives
 * **The following directives have been deprecated and *will be removed* in a future release of the EncoreUI
 * framework.** They are still functional, but **WILL display a warning in the javascript console** to let you know
 * you should upgrade your code.
 *
 * ### **rxFormItem**
 * See "Before & After" below
 *
 * ### **rxFormFieldset**
 * Closest equivalent is to use `rxFormSection`. Your individual project requirements will vary, but the `legend`
 * attribute can be replaced with a heading variant where applicable.
 *
 * * If your legend pertains to at least one row, place a heading variant before the desired `rx-form-section`
 * element.
 * * If your legend pertains to controls in a single column, place a heading variant within the `rx-field`
 * element at the top.
 *
 * ## Before &amp; After
 * The `rxFormItem` has been found to be incredibly brittle and prone to breakage. The new markup may look a little
 * wordy, but it is designed to provide enough flexibility for advanced field inputs. To be explicit, the new directives
 * were designed based on feedback around:
 *
 * * applying custom HTML markup for `label`, `description`, `prefix`, and `suffix` properties
 * * standardizing form layout functionality
 * * eliminating unnecessary CSS class definitions
 *
 * The following are some examples comparing what code looked like using the old directives versus the new directives.
 *

 *         Invalid email
 *     </div>
 *     <div ng-show="demoForm.userEmail.$error.foocheck" class="inline-error">
