 * @description
 * # typeahead Component
 *
 * This component provides styles and a demo for the
 * [the Angular-UI Bootstrap Typeahead plugin](https://goo.gl/EMGTTq),
 * which is included as a dependency for EncoreUI.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Usage is the exact same as demoed on the Angular-UI Bootstrap site. See
 * [the Angular-UI Bootstrap Docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/typeahead)
 * for further guidance on usage and configuration of this component.
 *
 * A feature has been added that shows the list of options when the input
 * receives focus.  This list is still filtered according to the input's value,
 * except when the input is empty.  In that case, all the options are shown.
 * To use this feature, add the `allowEmpty` parameter to the `filter` filter
 * in the `typeahead` attribute.  See the {@link /encore-ui/#/components/typeahead demo}
 * for an example.
